qubes windows tools lack to extract some dll files required to start services.

from https://groups.google.com/g/qubes-devel/c/d2dZ_D2oIlM/m/8XdROYgUAwAJ

Put the files into the following folders and you will see your qubes HVM with windows capable to copy files, copy clipboard, etc.

"C:\Program Files\Invisible Things Lab\Qubes Tools\bin"
"C:\Program Files\Invisible Things Lab\Qubes Tools\qubes-rpc-services"

then restart and done.
cheers!
